# <Prework-Study-Guide-Webpage>

## Description

-This study guide website was created as a useful tool, not only in storing students notes, but also as an exercise in learning how to code.  The study guide is organized in four separate sections covering the various coding studied in the bootcamp prework; i.e. html, css, GitHub, and JavaScript.

## Motivation and Inspiration for Completion

-I was motivated by a desire to learn coding in the interest of pursuing a change in career path.

-I built this project in order to learn basic coding and as a means of taking and organizing my notes for further study.

-The study guide provides a way of memorializing the information learned in the various topics for quick reference.

-I learned how to create, add, and upload files, create feature branches to avoid data loss using git bash, basic html, css, and JavaScript coding, and how to sync files using GitHub.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)

## Installation

Create directories in Git and add feature branches for version control. Code html, css and JavaScript in Visual Studio Code, working on feature branch(es) then pushing them to GitHub.

## Usage

-For use as a means of storing notes for further study, the user adds lines of code with their notes in the various notes sections.

-To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

## Credits

-I did not have any collaborators on this early project.

-I used coding instructions from the University of Denver Coding Bootcamp program in the creation of this study guide.

-I also found useful information on the web pages listed below:

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/nielsenjared/badmath)

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests
-Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
