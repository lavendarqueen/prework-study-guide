# <Prework-Study-Guide-Webpage>

## Description

-This study guide website was created as a useful tool, not only in storing students notes, but also as an exercise in learning how to code.  The study guide is organized in four separate sections covering the various coding studied in the bootcamp prework; i.e. html, css, GitHub, and JavaScript.

## Motivation and Inspiration for Completion

-I was motivated to take the coding bootcamp offered by University of Denver and thus create the Prework Study Guide by a desire to learn coding in the interest of pursuing a change in career path.

-I built this project in order to learn basic coding and as a means of taking and organizing my notes for further study.

-The study guide provides a way of memorializing the information learned in the various topics for quick reference.

-I learned how to create, add, and upload files, create feature branches to avoid data loss using git, basic html, css, and JavaScript coding, and how to sync files using GitHub. I also learned how to research issues on various web pages.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Installation

Create directories in Git and add feature branches for version control. Code html, css and JavaScript in Visual Studio Code, working on feature branch(es) then pushing them to GitHub.

## Usage

-For use as a means of storing notes for further study, the user adds lines of code with their notes in the various notes sections.
